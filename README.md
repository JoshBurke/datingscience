This project analyzes your dating history data to determine which factors contribute most to your relationship satisfaction, helping you make more informed dating decisions in the future.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Examine correlations between various factors and relationship satisfaction
- **Regression Analysis**: Run multiple regression models to identify key predictors
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to better understand your dating patterns
- **Weighted Criteria**: Calculate optimal weights for different dating criteria based on your past experiences

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure your dating history CSV file is in the same directory as the script (default filename: `history.csv`)

## Usage

Run the analysis script:

```
python dating_analysis.py
```

The script will:
1. Load and analyze your dating history data
2. Generate visualizations saved as PNG files:
   - `correlation_matrix.png`: Correlation between all factors
   - `top_factors_scatter.png`: Scatter plot of top factors vs. satisfaction
